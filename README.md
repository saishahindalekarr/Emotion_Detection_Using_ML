# Emotion Detection Using AI (Facial Expression Recognition)

## 📊 Project Overview
This project is an AI-based Emotion Detection system that identifies human emotions using facial expressions in real-time through a webcam. It uses Machine Learning and Computer Vision techniques to detect emotions such as happy, sad, angry, and neutral.

The system can be integrated with mental health support platforms and interactive chatbots to provide emotional insights and support.
